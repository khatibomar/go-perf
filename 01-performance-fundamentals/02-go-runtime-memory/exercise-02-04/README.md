# Exercise 02-04: Memory Layout Visualization

**Objective:** Visualize memory usage patterns and understand their impact on performance.

**Duration:** 90-120 minutes

## Tasks

### Task 1: Memory Layout Analysis
1. Examine `memory_layout.go` for different memory patterns:
   - Struct layout and padding
   - Array vs slice memory layout
   - Pointer vs value semantics
   - Memory alignment considerations

### Task 2: Runtime Memory Statistics
1. Use `runtime.MemStats` to analyze memory usage:
   ```go
   var m runtime.MemStats
   runtime.ReadMemStats(&m)
   ```
2. Monitor key metrics:
   - Heap size and usage
   - GC frequency and duration
   - Allocation rate
   - Memory fragmentation

### Task 3: Memory Usage Visualization
1. Create memory usage visualizations:
   - Heap growth patterns
   - Allocation hotspots
   - GC impact on performance
   - Memory fragmentation analysis

### Task 4: GC Impact Analysis
1. Benchmark with different GC settings:
   ```bash
   GOGC=100 go test -bench=.
   GOGC=200 go test -bench=.
   GOGC=50 go test -bench=.
   ```
2. Analyze GC impact on performance
3. Understand GC tuning trade-offs

### Task 5: Memory Layout Optimization
1. Implement memory-efficient data structures:
   - Struct field ordering
   - Memory pool usage
   - Cache-friendly layouts
   - Reduced pointer chasing

### Task 6: Real-time Memory Monitoring
1. Create memory monitoring tools:
   - Real-time memory usage tracking
   - Allocation rate monitoring
   - GC pressure detection
   - Memory leak detection

## Key Learning Points
- Memory layout impact on performance
- GC behavior and tuning strategies
- Memory monitoring and visualization techniques
- Cache-friendly data structure design
- Memory leak detection and prevention

## Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of Go's memory layout
- Ability to optimize memory usage patterns
- Skills in memory monitoring and analysis
- Knowledge of GC tuning and optimization

## Files
- `memory_layout.go` - Memory layout analysis and optimization
- `benchmark_test.go` - Memory performance benchmarks

## Memory Layout Principles
1. **Struct Padding**: Align fields for optimal memory usage
2. **Cache Lines**: Design for CPU cache efficiency
3. **Pointer Density**: Minimize pointers to reduce GC overhead
4. **Memory Pools**: Reuse memory to reduce allocation pressure
5. **Data Locality**: Keep related data together

## Memory Monitoring Metrics
- **HeapAlloc**: Currently allocated heap memory
- **HeapSys**: Total heap memory from OS
- **HeapIdle**: Idle heap memory
- **HeapInuse**: In-use heap memory
- **GCCPUFraction**: CPU time spent in GC
- **NumGC**: Number of GC cycles

## GC Tuning Guidelines
- **GOGC=100** (default): Balanced performance/memory
- **GOGC=200**: Lower GC frequency, higher memory usage
- **GOGC=50**: Higher GC frequency, lower memory usage
- **GOMEMLIMIT**: Set memory limit for GC tuning

## Performance Optimization Strategies
1. **Reduce Allocations**: Minimize heap pressure
2. **Optimize Layout**: Improve cache locality
3. **Pool Objects**: Reuse expensive allocations
4. **Monitor GC**: Track GC impact on performance
5. **Profile Memory**: Use pprof for detailed analysis

## Common Memory Issues
- Memory leaks (growing heap)
- Excessive allocations (GC pressure)
- Poor cache locality (performance degradation)
- Memory fragmentation (inefficient usage)
- Large object allocations (GC overhead)

## Next Steps
With solid understanding of Go runtime and memory, proceed to Chapter 03 to learn about profiling with pprof.
