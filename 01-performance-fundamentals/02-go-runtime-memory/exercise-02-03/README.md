# Exercise 02-03: Goroutine Scheduler Analysis

**Objective:** Understand how the Go scheduler works and optimize goroutine usage patterns.

**Duration:** 90-120 minutes

## Tasks

### Task 1: Scheduler Fundamentals
1. Examine `scheduler_analysis.go` for different goroutine patterns:
   - CPU-bound vs I/O-bound goroutines
   - Goroutine creation and lifecycle
   - Work distribution patterns
   - Synchronization overhead

### Task 2: Scheduler Debugging
1. Use GODEBUG to analyze scheduler behavior:
   ```bash
   GODEBUG=schedtrace=1000 go run scheduler_analysis.go
   GODEBUG=scheddetail=1 go run scheduler_analysis.go
   ```
2. Understand scheduler output:
   - P (processor) utilization
   - M (machine/thread) usage
   - G (goroutine) states
   - Work stealing behavior

### Task 3: Goroutine Performance Patterns
1. Benchmark different goroutine usage patterns:
   ```bash
   go test -bench=. -benchmem
   ```
2. Compare:
   - Goroutine creation overhead
   - Context switching costs
   - Synchronization primitives performance
   - Work distribution efficiency

### Task 4: GOMAXPROCS Impact
1. Test performance with different GOMAXPROCS values:
   ```bash
   GOMAXPROCS=1 go test -bench=.
   GOMAXPROCS=2 go test -bench=.
   GOMAXPROCS=4 go test -bench=.
   GOMAXPROCS=8 go test -bench=.
   ```
2. Analyze scaling characteristics
3. Understand optimal processor count

### Task 5: Scheduler Optimization
1. Implement optimized goroutine patterns:
   - Worker pool patterns
   - Batch processing
   - Load balancing strategies
   - Efficient synchronization

### Task 6: Execution Tracing
1. Generate execution traces:
   ```bash
   go test -bench=. -trace=trace.out
   go tool trace trace.out
   ```
2. Analyze goroutine execution patterns
3. Identify scheduling bottlenecks

## Key Learning Points
- Go scheduler (GMP model) internals
- Goroutine lifecycle and state transitions
- Work stealing and load balancing
- Impact of GOMAXPROCS on performance
- Scheduler debugging and optimization techniques

## Expected Outcomes
- Deep understanding of Go's scheduler
- Ability to optimize goroutine usage patterns
- Skills in scheduler debugging and analysis
- Knowledge of concurrency performance optimization

## Files
- `scheduler_analysis.go` - Goroutine patterns and scheduler analysis
- `benchmark_test.go` - Scheduler performance benchmarks

## Scheduler Performance Characteristics
- Goroutine creation: ~1-10μs
- Context switch: ~1-5μs
- Channel operation: ~50-200ns
- Mutex lock/unlock: ~20-100ns
- Work stealing overhead: ~100-500ns

## Optimization Guidelines
1. **Right-size goroutines**: Not too many, not too few
2. **Minimize synchronization**: Reduce contention
3. **Use worker pools**: For high-frequency tasks
4. **Batch work**: Reduce scheduling overhead
5. **Profile scheduler**: Use traces and GODEBUG

## Common Scheduler Issues
- Too many goroutines (scheduling overhead)
- Goroutine leaks (memory and scheduler pressure)
- Excessive synchronization (contention)
- Poor work distribution (load imbalance)
- Blocking operations in tight loops
