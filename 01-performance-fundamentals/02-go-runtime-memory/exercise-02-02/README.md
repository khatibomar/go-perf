# Exercise 02-02: Memory Allocation Patterns

**Objective:** Analyze different memory allocation patterns and their performance characteristics.

**Duration:** 90-120 minutes

## Tasks

### Task 1: Slice Allocation Patterns
1. Examine `allocation_patterns.go` for different slice allocation strategies:
   - Append-based growth
   - Pre-allocated slices
   - Slice capacity management
   - Multi-dimensional slices

### Task 2: Map Allocation Analysis
1. Study map allocation patterns:
   - Map initialization strategies
   - Capacity hints and performance
   - Key type impact on performance
   - Map vs slice trade-offs

### Task 3: Interface Allocation Costs
1. Analyze interface allocation overhead:
   - Interface{} vs typed interfaces
   - Value vs pointer in interfaces
   - Type assertions and conversions
   - Interface method call overhead

### Task 4: Benchmark Allocation Patterns
1. Run comprehensive benchmarks:
   ```bash
   go test -bench=. -benchmem
   ```
2. Compare allocation patterns:
   - Memory usage per operation
   - Allocation frequency
   - GC pressure impact
   - Performance characteristics

### Task 5: Memory Usage Optimization
1. Implement optimized allocation strategies:
   - Slice pre-allocation
   - Map capacity hints
   - Pool-based allocation
   - Memory reuse patterns

### Task 6: Real-world Application
1. Apply learnings to realistic scenarios:
   - Data processing pipelines
   - Web request handling
   - Batch processing operations
   - Stream processing patterns

## Key Learning Points
- Slice growth patterns and performance implications
- Map allocation strategies and capacity planning
- Interface allocation overhead and optimization
- Memory pool patterns for high-frequency allocations
- GC pressure reduction techniques

## Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of Go's memory allocation behavior
- Ability to choose optimal allocation strategies
- Skills in reducing memory allocation overhead
- Knowledge of memory-efficient programming patterns

## Files
- `allocation_patterns.go` - Various allocation pattern implementations
- `benchmark_test.go` - Comprehensive allocation benchmarks

## Allocation Performance Guidelines
- Pre-allocate slices when size is known
- Use capacity hints for maps
- Avoid unnecessary interface allocations
- Consider object pooling for high-frequency allocations
- Monitor GC pressure in allocation-heavy code

## Memory Allocation Costs
- Slice append (no realloc): ~5ns
- Slice append (with realloc): ~50-500ns
- Map insertion: ~50-200ns
- Interface allocation: ~10-50ns
- Small object allocation: ~10-30ns

## Optimization Strategies
1. **Pre-allocation**: Allocate with known capacity
2. **Pooling**: Reuse objects to reduce allocations
3. **Batching**: Process multiple items per allocation
4. **Streaming**: Process data without full materialization
