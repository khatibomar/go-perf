## Theory: Performance Optimization Principles

### The Performance Mindset

Performance optimization is not about writing "fast code" from the start. It's about:

1. **Measure First, Optimize Second**
   - Never assume where bottlenecks are
   - Use data to drive decisions
   - Profile before and after changes

2. **Understand Your Requirements**
   - What is "fast enough" for your use case?
   - Latency vs throughput trade-offs
   - Resource constraints (CPU, memory, network)

3. **Optimize the Right Things**
   - Focus on hot paths (code that runs frequently)
   - 80/20 rule: 80% of time spent in 20% of code
   - Don't optimize code that rarely runs

### Performance Optimization Methodology

```
1. BASELINE → 2. MEASURE → 3. ANALYZE → 4. OPTIMIZE → 5. VERIFY → (repeat)
     ↑                                                        |
     └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Step 1: Establish Baseline**
- Create reproducible test scenarios
- Document current performance metrics
- Set up monitoring and alerting

**Step 2: Measure Performance**
- Use profiling tools (pprof, trace)
- Collect metrics (CPU, memory, I/O)
- Identify bottlenecks

**Step 3: Analyze Results**
- Understand why bottlenecks exist
- Research potential solutions
- Estimate impact of changes

**Step 4: Optimize**
- Make targeted changes
- One optimization at a time
- Keep changes small and focused

**Step 5: Verify Improvements**
- Re-measure performance
- Ensure no regressions
- Document improvements

### Common Performance Anti-Patterns

❌ **Premature Optimization**
```go
// DON'T: Optimizing before measuring
func processData(data []string) []string {
    // Complex optimization that may not be needed
    result := make([]string, 0, len(data)*2) // Pre-allocating too much
    // ... complex logic
    return result
}
```

✅ **Measure-Driven Optimization**
```go
// DO: Start simple, then optimize based on profiling
func processData(data []string) []string {
    var result []string
    for _, item := range data {
        // Simple, readable logic first
        processed := strings.ToUpper(item)
        result = append(result, processed)
    }
    return result
}
```

❌ **Micro-Optimizations Without Context**
```go
// DON'T: Optimizing insignificant code
func rarely_called_function() {
    // Spending time optimizing code that runs once per hour
}
```

❌ **Ignoring Algorithmic Complexity**
```go
// DON'T: O(n²) when O(n) is possible
func findDuplicates(items []string) []string {
    var duplicates []string
    for i := 0; i < len(items); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(items); j++ {
            if items[i] == items[j] {
                duplicates = append(duplicates, items[i])
            }
        }
    }
    return duplicates
}
```

✅ **Algorithm-First Optimization**
```go
// DO: Better algorithm first
func findDuplicates(items []string) []string {
    seen := make(map[string]bool)
    var duplicates []string
    
    for _, item := range items {
        if seen[item] {
            duplicates = append(duplicates, item)
        } else {
            seen[item] = true
        }
    }
    return duplicates
}
```
