This is a sample text file for memory-conscious processing.
Each line will be processed by the pipeline.
The system demonstrates efficient memory usage through:
- Buffer pooling for memory reuse
- Chunked processing to limit memory footprint
- Memory pressure monitoring and cleanup
- Configurable worker pools for concurrency

This file contains multiple lines of text.
Some lines are longer than others to test variable chunk sizes.
The pipeline will transform this text according to the specified processor.

Memory optimization techniques used:
1. Object pooling to reduce garbage collection
2. Streaming processing to handle large files
3. Backpressure control to prevent memory overflow
4. Efficient buffer management
5. Real-time memory monitoring

End of sample file.
