# Exercise 04-01: Zero-Allocation Implementations

**Objective:** Implement zero-allocation versions of common operations

## Learning Goals

By completing this exercise, you will:
- ✅ Master zero-allocation programming techniques
- ✅ Understand escape analysis and its implications
- ✅ Implement in-place algorithms effectively
- ✅ Use pre-allocated buffers for optimal performance
- ✅ Measure and verify allocation reduction

## Background

Zero-allocation programming is a critical technique for high-performance Go applications. By eliminating heap allocations in hot code paths, we can:
- Reduce garbage collection pressure
- Improve cache locality
- Achieve predictable performance
- Minimize memory fragmentation

## Tasks

### Task 1: String Processing Without Allocations
Implement string manipulation functions that avoid allocations:
- String concatenation using pre-allocated buffers
- String splitting with reusable slices
- String formatting without fmt.Sprintf

### Task 2: In-Place Data Processing
Convert allocation-heavy algorithms to in-place versions:
- Sorting algorithms that work in-place
- Data transformation without intermediate allocations
- Buffer manipulation techniques

### Task 3: Buffer Reuse Patterns
Implement effective buffer reuse strategies:
- Pre-allocated buffer pools
- Buffer size optimization
- Lifecycle management

### Task 4: Performance Measurement
Measure and verify allocation improvements:
- Benchmark allocation counts
- Compare memory usage patterns
- Analyze performance improvements

- `string_processing.go` - String processing without allocations
- `zero_alloc_test.go` - Zero-allocation benchmarks

## Key Concepts

### Escape Analysis
Understanding when variables escape to the heap:
```bash
go build -gcflags="-m" .
```

### Buffer Reuse
Reusing buffers to avoid allocations:
```go
func ProcessWithBuffer(data []byte, buffer []byte) []byte {
    // Use buffer instead of allocating
    return buffer[:processedLength]
}
```

### In-Place Operations
Modifying data without creating copies:
```go
func ReverseInPlace(slice []int) {
    for i, j := 0, len(slice)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
        slice[i], slice[j] = slice[j], slice[i]
    }
}
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All functions achieve zero allocations in benchmarks
- [ ] Performance improvements of 2-5x over allocating versions
- [ ] Code maintains readability and correctness
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage

## Running the Exercise

```bash
# Run tests
go test -v

# Run benchmarks
go test -bench=. -benchmem

# Check for allocations
go test -bench=. -benchmem | grep "0 allocs/op"

# Escape analysis
go build -gcflags="-m" .
```

## Expected Results

After optimization, you should see:
- 0 allocs/op in all zero-allocation benchmarks
- Significant performance improvements
- Reduced memory usage
- Lower GC pressure
