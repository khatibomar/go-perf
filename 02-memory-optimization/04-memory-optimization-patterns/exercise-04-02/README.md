# Exercise 04-02: Memory-Efficient Data Structures

## Learning Goals
- Understand memory layout and cache efficiency
- Implement memory-efficient data structures
- Compare memory usage of different data structure designs
- Optimize data structures for specific access patterns

## Background

Memory-efficient data structures are crucial for high-performance applications. This exercise focuses on:

### Key Concepts
1. **Struct of Arrays (SoA) vs Array of Structs (AoS)**
2. **Memory alignment and padding**
3. **Cache-friendly data layouts**
4. **Compact data representations**
5. **Memory pooling for small objects**

### Memory Layout Patterns
- **Hot/Cold Data Separation**: Separate frequently accessed fields
- **Bit Packing**: Use bit fields for boolean flags
- **String Interning**: Reuse common strings
- **Flyweight Pattern**: Share common data

## Tasks

### Task 1: Struct Layout Optimization
Implement different struct layouts and measure their memory efficiency:
- Compare AoS vs SoA for bulk operations
- Optimize struct field ordering for minimal padding
- Use bit fields for flags and small integers

### Task 2: Cache-Friendly Collections
Implement memory-efficient collections:
- Contiguous arrays vs linked structures
- Custom hash tables with open addressing
- Compact trees and tries

### Task 3: Memory Pool Implementation
Create memory pools for different object sizes:
- Fixed-size object pools
- Slab allocators
- Ring buffers for streaming data

### Task 4: Compact Data Representations
Implement space-efficient data formats:
- Variable-length encoding
- Compressed data structures
- Shared string tables

## Files
- `data_structures.go` - Memory-efficient data structure implementations
- `memory_pool.go` - Object pooling and memory management
- `compact_formats.go` - Space-efficient data representations
- `data_structures_test.go` - Tests and benchmarks

## Key Concepts
- **Memory Alignment**: Understanding CPU cache line sizes
- **False Sharing**: Avoiding cache line contention
- **Locality of Reference**: Spatial and temporal locality
- **Memory Fragmentation**: Internal vs external fragmentation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Demonstrate 30%+ memory reduction with SoA vs AoS
- [ ] Show improved cache performance with contiguous layouts
- [ ] Implement working memory pools with <1% overhead
- [ ] Achieve 50%+ space savings with compact representations
- [ ] All benchmarks show measurable improvements

## Running the Exercise

```bash
# Run tests
go test -v

# Run benchmarks
go test -bench=. -benchmem

# Run memory profiling
go test -bench=. -memprofile=mem.prof
go tool pprof mem.prof
```

## Expected Results
- Memory usage reduction in bulk operations
- Improved cache hit rates
- Reduced allocation overhead
- Better memory locality
