# Chapter 02: Garbage Collection Mastery

## Overview

This chapter provides comprehensive coverage of Go's garbage collector, from understanding its internals to mastering optimization techniques. You'll learn how to work with the GC rather than against it, minimize GC pressure, and tune GC behavior for optimal performance.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this chapter, you will:

- **Understand GC Internals**: Master Go's tricolor concurrent mark-and-sweep collector
- **Analyze GC Behavior**: Use profiling tools to understand GC impact on your applications
- **Minimize GC Pressure**: Implement strategies to reduce allocation rates and GC overhead
- **Optimize GC Tuning**: Configure GC parameters for different workload patterns
- **Handle Large Objects**: Understand and optimize large object allocation patterns
- **Implement GC-Friendly Patterns**: Design code that works efficiently with Go's GC

## Theoretical Foundations

### Go's Garbage Collector Architecture

#### Tricolor Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm
- **White Objects**: Unreachable, candidates for collection
- **Gray Objects**: Reachable but not yet scanned
- **Black Objects**: Reachable and fully scanned
- **Concurrent Execution**: GC runs concurrently with application
- **Write Barriers**: Maintain consistency during concurrent marking

#### GC Phases
1. **Mark Setup**: Prepare for marking phase
2. **Concurrent Mark**: Mark reachable objects while application runs
3. **Mark Termination**: Complete marking and prepare for sweep
4. **Concurrent Sweep**: Reclaim memory of unreachable objects

#### Memory Layout
- **Heap Organization**: Spans, pages, and size classes
- **Generation Hypothesis**: Most objects die young
- **Large Object Handling**: Special treatment for objects >32KB
- **Stack Scanning**: Conservative scanning of goroutine stacks

### GC Performance Characteristics

#### Latency vs Throughput
- **Stop-the-World (STW) Time**: Minimized but not eliminated
- **GC Overhead**: CPU time spent on garbage collection
- **Memory Overhead**: Extra memory needed for GC metadata
- **Allocation Rate Impact**: Higher allocation rates increase GC frequency

#### GC Triggers
- **Heap Size Target**: GOGC environment variable (default 100%)
- **Allocation Rate**: Pacing based on allocation speed
- **Manual Triggers**: `runtime.GC()` calls
- **Memory Pressure**: System memory constraints

## Tools and IDE Integration

### Command Line Tools
```bash
# GC trace analysis
GOGC=100 GODEBUG=gctrace=1 go run main.go

# Memory profiling
go test -memprofile=mem.prof -bench=.
go tool pprof mem.prof

# GC latency analysis
go test -trace=trace.out -bench=.
go tool trace trace.out

# Allocation profiling
go test -memprofile=alloc.prof -memprofilerate=1 -bench=.
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# GC tuning
export GOGC=200              # Set GC target to 200%
export GOMEMLIMIT=4GiB       # Set memory limit
export GODEBUG=gctrace=1     # Enable GC tracing
export GODEBUG=gcpacertrace=1 # Enable GC pacer tracing
```
