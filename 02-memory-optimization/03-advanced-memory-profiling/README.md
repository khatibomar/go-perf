# Chapter 03: Advanced Memory Profiling

**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Prerequisites:** Chapters 01-02 of this module

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- âœ… Set up continuous memory profiling in production
- âœ… Detect and prevent memory leaks systematically
- âœ… Track allocation patterns and optimize them
- âœ… Analyze memory usage patterns in complex applications
- âœ… Integrate memory monitoring with observability systems
- âœ… Build automated memory regression detection

## Theory: Production-Grade Memory Analysis

### Continuous Memory Profiling

Continuous profiling allows you to monitor memory usage patterns over time in production environments:

```go
// Continuous profiling setup
func setupContinuousProfiler() {
    go func() {
        ticker := time.NewTicker(30 * time.Second)
        defer ticker.Stop()
        
        for {
            select {
            case <-ticker.C:
                collectMemoryProfile()
            }
        }
    }()
}
```

### Memory Leak Detection Strategies

1. **Heap Growth Monitoring**
   - Track heap size over time
   - Identify abnormal growth patterns
   - Set up automated alerts

2. **Object Lifecycle Tracking**
   - Monitor object creation/destruction
   - Identify objects that should be garbage collected
   - Track reference cycles

3. **Allocation Pattern Analysis**
   - Identify allocation hotspots
   - Track allocation sources
   - Monitor allocation frequency

### Integration with Observability

```go
// Prometheus metrics integration
var (
    heapSize = prometheus.NewGaugeVec(
        prometheus.GaugeOpts{
            Name: "go_memory_heap_bytes",
            Help: "Current heap size in bytes",
        },
        []string{"instance"},
    )
    
    allocRate = prometheus.NewCounterVec(
        prometheus.CounterOpts{
            Name: "go_memory_allocs_total",
            Help: "Total number of allocations",
        },
        []string{"instance"},
    )
)
```
