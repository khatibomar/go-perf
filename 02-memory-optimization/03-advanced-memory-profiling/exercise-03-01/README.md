# Exercise 03-01: Continuous Profiling Setup

## Objective
Implement continuous memory profiling for production applications with automated collection, storage, and analysis.

## Background
Continuous profiling allows you to monitor memory usage patterns over time in production environments, enabling proactive detection of memory issues and performance regressions.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Automated Profile Collection
Implement a system that automatically collects memory profiles at regular intervals.

### Task 2: Profile Storage and Rotation
Create a storage system for profiles with automatic rotation to manage disk space.

### Task 3: Memory Usage Dashboards
Build dashboards to visualize memory usage trends over time.

### Task 4: Alerting for Memory Anomalies
Set up automated alerting when memory usage patterns indicate potential issues.

## Expected Outcomes
- Continuous memory profile collection system
- Efficient profile storage with rotation
- Real-time memory usage visualization
- Automated anomaly detection and alerting

## Files
- `continuous_profiler.go` - Main profiling system
- `profile_storage.go` - Profile storage and rotation
- `dashboard.go` - Memory usage dashboard
- `alerting.go` - Anomaly detection and alerting
- `benchmark_test.go` - Performance tests

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Profiles collected automatically every 30 seconds
- [ ] Profile storage with 7-day retention
- [ ] Dashboard showing memory trends
- [ ] Alerts triggered for memory anomalies
- [ ] System overhead < 1% of application performance
