# Exercise 03-02: Memory Leak Detection

## Objective
Implement comprehensive memory leak detection strategies using Go's profiling tools and custom monitoring solutions.

## Background
Memory leaks in Go applications can be subtle and difficult to detect. While Go's garbage collector handles most memory management automatically, leaks can still occur through:
- Goroutine leaks
- Unclosed resources (files, network connections)
- Growing slices/maps that are never cleaned
- Circular references with finalizers
- Improper use of global variables

This exercise teaches you to build robust leak detection systems that can identify these issues in production environments.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Leak Detection Engine
Implement a memory leak detection engine that:
- Monitors memory growth patterns over time
- Identifies suspicious allocation patterns
- Tracks goroutine counts and states
- Detects resource leaks (file descriptors, network connections)
- Provides detailed leak reports with stack traces

### Task 2: Leak Simulation Framework
Create a framework for simulating different types of memory leaks:
- Goroutine leaks (blocked goroutines, infinite loops)
- Resource leaks (unclosed files, connections)
- Data structure leaks (growing maps, slices)
- Reference leaks (event listeners, callbacks)

### Task 3: Automated Leak Testing
Develop automated testing tools that:
- Run leak detection during application lifecycle
- Generate leak reports with actionable insights
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for early detection
- Provide baseline comparisons and trend analysis

### Task 4: Production Leak Monitoring
Implement production-ready leak monitoring that:
- Continuously monitors memory patterns
- Sends alerts when leaks are detected
- Provides real-time dashboards for memory health
- Integrates with existing monitoring infrastructure

## Expected Outcomes

After completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Identify and classify different types of memory leaks
- Implement automated leak detection systems
- Create comprehensive leak testing frameworks
- Monitor memory health in production environments
- Generate actionable leak reports and remediation strategies

## Files

- `leak_detector.go` - Core leak detection engine
- `leak_simulator.go` - Framework for simulating various leak types
- `leak_analyzer.go` - Analysis and reporting tools
- `leak_monitor.go` - Production monitoring system
- `leak_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite
- `benchmark_test.go` - Performance benchmarks

## Success Criteria

1. **Detection Accuracy**: Successfully identify 95%+ of simulated leaks
2. **False Positive Rate**: Keep false positives below 5%
3. **Performance Impact**: Monitoring overhead < 2% of application performance
4. **Response Time**: Detect leaks within 5 minutes of occurrence
5. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing monitoring tools

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Run leak detection tests
go test -v ./...

# Run performance benchmarks
go test -bench=. -benchmem

# Start leak monitoring server
go run . -mode=monitor -port=8081

# Simulate specific leak types
go run . -mode=simulate -leak-type=goroutine
```
