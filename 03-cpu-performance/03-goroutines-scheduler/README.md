## Key Performance Metrics

- **Goroutine Count** - Number of active goroutines

- **Work Stealing Events** - Load balancing effectiveness
- **GC Assist Time** - Scheduler impact on garbage collection

## Common Performance Issues

1. **Goroutine Explosion** - Creating too many goroutines
2. **Poor Work Distribution** - Uneven load across processors
3. **Blocking Operations** - Goroutines blocking scheduler threads
4. **Inefficient Synchronization** - Excessive lock contention
5. **Memory Pressure** - Large goroutine stacks affecting performance
6. **Channel Bottlenecks** - Poorly designed channel communication

## Tools and Techniques

### Analysis Tools
- `go tool trace` - Execution tracing
- `runtime.NumGoroutine()` - Goroutine counting
- `runtime.GOMAXPROCS()` - Processor configuration
- `runtime.GC()` - Manual garbage collection
- `pprof` - Goroutine profiling

### Monitoring Metrics
- `runtime.MemStats` - Memory and GC statistics
- `runtime.NumCPU()` - Available CPU cores
- Custom metrics for goroutine lifecycle
- Scheduler latency measurements

### Optimization Patterns
