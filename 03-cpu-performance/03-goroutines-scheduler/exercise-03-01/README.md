# Exercise 03-01: Scheduler Analysis and Visualization

This exercise provides comprehensive tools for analyzing and visualizing Go scheduler performance. It includes workload generators, performance analysis, tracing capabilities, and detailed reporting.

## Overview

The Go scheduler is a sophisticated work-stealing scheduler that manages goroutines across OS threads (M) and logical processors (P). This exercise helps you understand:

- How different workloads affect scheduler behavior
- Performance characteristics of CPU-bound vs I/O-bound workloads
- Impact of GOMAXPROCS on different workload types
- Scheduler efficiency and bottleneck identification
- Goroutine lifecycle and contention analysis

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Workload Implementations

Implement different types of workloads to observe scheduler behavior:

#### CPU-Bound Workload
- Mathematical computations (prime number generation)
- Matrix operations
- Cryptographic operations
- Sorting algorithms

#### I/O-Bound Workload
- File operations
- Network requests
- Database queries (simulated)
- Sleep operations

#### Mixed Workload
- Combination of CPU and I/O operations
- Realistic application simulation
- Variable load patterns

### Task 2: Trace Generation

Implement trace generation for different scenarios:
- Single vs multiple goroutines
- Different GOMAXPROCS values
- Various workload intensities
- Scheduler stress testing

### Task 3: Analysis Tools

Build tools to analyze scheduler behavior:
- Parse execution traces
- Extract scheduler metrics
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Generate performance reports

### Task 4: Visualization

Create visualizations for:
- Goroutine execution timelines
- Processor utilization
- Work stealing events
- Scheduler latency distribution

## Key Metrics to Measure

### Scheduler Performance
- **Scheduler Latency**: Time from goroutine ready to running
- **Context Switch Rate**: Frequency of goroutine switches
- **Work Stealing Events**: Load balancing effectiveness
- **Processor Utilization**: Efficiency of P usage

### Goroutine Metrics
- **Goroutine Count**: Number of active goroutines
- **Creation Rate**: Goroutines created per second
- **Lifetime Distribution**: How long goroutines live
- **Blocking Time**: Time spent blocked on operations

### System Metrics
- **CPU Utilization**: Overall system CPU usage
- **Memory Usage**: Scheduler memory overhead
- **GC Impact**: Garbage collection effect on scheduling
- **OS Thread Count**: Number of OS threads used

## Expected Observations

### CPU-Bound Workloads
- High processor utilization
- Minimal work stealing (even distribution)
- Low scheduler latency
- Preemption-based context switches

### I/O-Bound Workloads
- Frequent goroutine blocking
- More work stealing events
- Higher scheduler latency variance
- Voluntary context switches

### Mixed Workloads
- Complex scheduling patterns
- Variable processor utilization
- Adaptive work distribution
- Realistic application behavior

## Analysis Questions

1. **How does GOMAXPROCS affect scheduler behavior for different workload types?**
2. **What is the relationship between goroutine count and scheduler efficiency?**
3. **How does work stealing contribute to load balancing?**
4. **What are the performance implications of frequent goroutine creation?**
5. **How does the scheduler handle mixed CPU/I/O workloads?**

## Performance Optimization Insights

### Scheduler Tuning
- Optimal GOMAXPROCS for workload type
- Goroutine pool sizing strategies
- Load balancing effectiveness
- Preemption impact on performance

### Application Design
- Goroutine lifecycle management
- Work distribution patterns
- Synchronization overhead
- Resource utilization efficiency

## Tools and Commands

### Trace Generation
```bash
# Generate execution trace
go run main.go -trace=trace.out -workload=cpu -duration=10s

# View trace in browser
go tool trace trace.out
```

### Analysis Commands
```bash
# Extract scheduler statistics
go tool trace -pprof=sched trace.out > sched.pprof

# Analyze goroutine behavior
go tool pprof sched.pprof
```

### Benchmarking
```bash
# Run scheduler benchmarks
go test -bench=BenchmarkScheduler -benchtime=10s

# Profile during benchmarks
go test -bench=. -trace=bench.trace
```

## Success Criteria

1. **Trace Generation**: Successfully generate traces for all workload types
2. **Analysis Tools**: Build working tools to extract scheduler metrics
3. **Visualization**: Create clear visualizations of scheduler behavior
4. **Performance Insights**: Identify optimization opportunities
5. **Documentation**: Document findings and recommendations
