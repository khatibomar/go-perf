# Exercise 03-02: Advanced Goroutine Pool Patterns

## Objective

Implement and optimize different goroutine pool patterns to understand their performance characteristics, trade-offs, and optimal use cases. This exercise focuses on building high-performance worker pools that can handle various workload patterns efficiently.

## Background

### Pool Design Patterns

Goroutine pools are essential for managing concurrent workloads efficiently. Different patterns serve different purposes:

1. **Fixed-Size Pool**: Maintains a constant number of workers, ideal for predictable workloads
2. **Dynamic Pool**: Scales workers based on demand, suitable for variable workloads
3. **Work-Stealing Pool**: Workers steal tasks from each other, optimizing load distribution
4. **Priority Pool**: Processes tasks based on priority levels, ensuring critical tasks execute first
5. **Batch Processing Pool**: Groups related tasks for more efficient processing

### Key Concepts

- **Worker Lifecycle Management**: Starting, stopping, and monitoring worker goroutines
- **Task Distribution**: Strategies for distributing work among available workers
- **Load Balancing**: Ensuring even distribution of work to maximize throughput
- **Backpressure Handling**: Managing situations when task submission exceeds processing capacity
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Properly terminating pools while completing in-flight tasks
